# TRACKIFY

 This is a Final Project for KTH DH2642. 

## What is TRACKIFY?

TRACKIFY is a website that displays the user listening data analytics. It will have users log into their Spotify accounts at first. Then, users are able to view an overview of top tracks, top artists, top genres and listening time.

## What we still plan to do
 
 - Main Page or Profiles
 - Top Genres Component
 - Listening Component
 - Overall CSS Work
  
## File structure of our project
 
 'spotify' is a top-level folder in our project. It contains 2 child folders, i.e., 'public' and 'src', and the 'src' folder contains a 'components' folder. 
 In a directory '/spotify/src/components', it includes 7 folders and each of them is for one react-component. They all contain at least one '.js' file and '.css' file.
